## Recipe App

![Preview](images/screenshot.png?raw=true)

This is a simple recipe app. You can search for almost anything and the recipe will be right in front of you.
As I am using the free API tier, I have a limit of sending 5 API requests per minute so if you find that the site is not loading, it will definitely load after a minute.
